# Idea behind the project

* Inventory / gameplay / capability tracking.
  * "FF Brave Exvius; These are the characters I have, these are the ones I want."
    * Share it with others, so that you can seek assistance as you need it.
* "My very own personal Wowhead" - lookup anything, find sources / droprates / recipes etc.
* Frame work for goal setting. Pick some outcomes that you want, and have the system tell you where to begin.
  * "Warframe; I want a Forma." This is how you find one pre-built, incl. how rare that is. This is where to get blueprints for it, plus materials.
    * Pick which way to get it. Both as a workaround for complicated methods where there can be multiple ways to accomplish it, AND to fit your own style.
  * "Modded Minecraft Skyblock; I want a Creative Tank of UU-matter."
    * Track what capabilities you have recorded in your inventory / properties, 
  * "Stardew Valley; I want to get the Greenhouse."
    * List out all the dependencies to get to it, restrictions around what can be obtained + when, and then track progress against objectives.
